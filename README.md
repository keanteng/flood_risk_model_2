# Flood Risk Model 2
For the second version of the flood risk model, more variables are included in the study compared to the previous [one](https://github.com/keanteng/flood_risk_model/tree/main). In this study, about 19, 000 labelled random coordinates were used where each coordinate is classified either has flood risk or has no flood risk. 

```
target = distance_to_hist_floodsite + altitude + slope + land_cover + town_distance + river_distance + cluster + error_term
```

Logistic regression performs quite well in the study with more than 98% accuracy and no sign of overfitting. State of the art-model like `XGBClassifier` is able to achieve 100% accuracy.

The labelled random coordinates were generated using `rancoord` a [Python package](https://github.com/hugodscarvalho/rancoord) that is capable of random sampling for geographic coordinates. To create labels for each coordinate, unique flood locations gathered from the 2020-2021 annual report published by the [Department of Irrigation and Drainage](https://www.water.gov.my/) were used to check whether the coordinate fall within 1.5 km radius of all the flood coordinates. 

Furthermore, the nearest distances between the random coordinates and the historical flood points were also computed using the `geopandas` module.

Features such as altitude, slope and land cover were collected by using [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/) services. For the land cover or land type, the information is gathered by using the [Copernicus Global Land Cover Layers](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_Landcover_100m_Proba-V-C3_Global)

For town distances, 62 largest towns from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_towns_in_Malaysia_by_population) were geocoded using [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html) and [Opencage](https://opencagedata.com/demo) geocoding services. The minimum distance between these towns and the random locations were computed. 

Moreover, to calculate the nearest river distance from the random coordinates, the waterways `shapefile` was collected from [HOTOSM Malaysia Waterways](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_mys_waterways?). The distance between points (coordinate) and the polygon (waterways shape file) ware computed. 

K-means clustering was used to create 15 clusters class based on the latitude and the longitude of each coordinate.
